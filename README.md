OSDev with JetBrains CLion
========================

This is a CMake configuration of the [Bare Bone tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) from [OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page).

Using CMake allows us to use CLion as our IDE for OS development which is more convenient than a simple text editor.

Look at the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) for more information about the build configuration.
